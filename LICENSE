 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and any scripts needed to control compilation and linking of the
Application with the Linked Version to produce the Combined Work.
(For example, the relevant make files for the Application.)  The
Corresponding Application Code need not include anything that the user
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Application Code.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under the terms of sections 3 and 4
of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Library's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all notices stating that this
License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy, and you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  3. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a copy of the Library combined with a copy of the GNU
GPL, as received, under the terms of section 4 of the GNU GPL, with an
additional permission that allows Covered Works based on the Library to
be conveyed under this License instead of the GPL.

  This section allows for the possibility of extending the Library so
that you can place it together with the GPL'd kernel in the same
Corresponding Source distribution as described in section 6 of the GNU
GPL, or in a kernel module.

  4. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  5. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you receive it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
receive it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you receive it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
